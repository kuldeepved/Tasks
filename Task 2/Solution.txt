Part 2 
Containerization:
The entire model environment, including code, libraries, and dependencies, is wrapped in a lightweight, portable Docker container.
This ensures the model can be portably deployed anywhere, maintaining the same environment, regardless of the underlying system.
For execution:
1. Create a Dockerfile: Add all the dependecies to setup the environment (dockerfile)
2. Build docker image: Using the command "docker build -t image-name/tag"
3. Run the container: After building the image we can run the container locally "docker run -p 5000:5000 "


Part 3 
YAML file is commonly used for adding configurations of CI/CD pipelines like workflows, environment variables, deployment configurations etc.
For CI/CD, YAML defines how pipeline should run i.e. steps to build, test, deploy model or application.
It is useful as we can add multiple stages of deployment.
